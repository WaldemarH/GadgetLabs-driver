THE FAQ:
---------------------------------------
Q1 - Is there a Windows XP/Vista/7 32/64bit driver for my GadgetLabs card?

Yes there is a brand new version 4.x driver which works with most Windows OSes.
Currently catalog files support XP SP2 and up(32bit), Vista(32/64bit) and 7 (32/64bit).
If somebody is using other OSes please mail me and the support for that system will be added.

---------------------------------------
Q2 - Where can I get the driver?

The latest version of the driver is available at
http://mostek.subcultural.com/ and http://gadgetlabs.org.

---------------------------------------
Q3 - Will the driver work with my GadgetLabs 424/496/824 card?

The driver works with all WavePro series cards.

---------------------------------------
Q4 - Will the driver work with my daughter card?

Daughter cards wont be supported.
The 824 Altera chip can't handle any more code in it -> it's working right at the borders already.
So I doubt I could squize anything else in there.

---------------------------------------
Q5 - Does the driver support 24 bit/96 kHz recording and playback?

Yes -> but only on 424/496 cards.

---------------------------------------
Q6- How do I enable the inputs on the GL?

All inputs and outputs are enabled automatically. If you want to use
them in audio software you have to enable them in that software and
not in 'Sound and Audio Settings' part of Windows ControlPanel.

'Sound and Audio Settings' part doesn't have any connection to the driver
whatsoever -> in here you set only how Windows will use the driver and not
how audio software will.

---------------------------------------
Q7 - Where is the GadgetLabs audio control panel?

If everything is working, it should be one of the icons in the system tray.

If it isn't there, start gadgetlabs_gui_32.exe (32 bit OSes) or gadgetlabs_gui_64.exe (64 bit OSes).

---------------------------------------
Q8 - I can't get MIDI to work with the driver.

The 4.0.0.x doesn't support MIDI anymore... maybe some of the next versions will.

---------------------------------------
Q9 - When I record multiple channels, the tracks are slightly out of
sync with one another. What is wrong?

1st Try using ASIO driver.

2nd WDM Drivers:
Driver is missing a time stamper so there is nothing you can do except manually align
the tracks. Adobe Audition is one of those apps.

3rd:
This can happen with some audio software if you have enabled
'Compensate for channel start' or something like this->disable it.

The reason is that driver is capable of starting all the channels in perfect sync.
So it doesn't need any start compensation.

---------------------------------------
Q10 - How many cards in the system does the driver support?

4.

Also the tests have shown that useful limit is at 2 cards per system.

---------------------------------------
Q11 - How can I sync my cards?

Open ControlPanel and click the Sync menu item.

Notice:
If menu is not enabled then your cards are missing sync cable.

---------------------------------------
Q12 - I'm getting dropouts. What should I do?

What does your CPU and disk performance meter show you?
  With small buffers the driver uses the dropouts can occur
  if your CPU or disk is running above 60% (it can run fine even up to 80%,
  but this is more a wish than anything).

You can even get dropouts if you have cheep hardware -> as normally they just take the system
until they finish -> no matter what.
  Similar symptoms can happen when you burn a CD -> as for some things to do the CDR driver just takes
  the system -> audio dropouts. Take notice that this doesn't mean you have a bad burner -> this
  is just a common thing they all do -> but yes, cheaper hardware do it more often.

Similar if you have hungry LAN cards... latest tests show that VmWare Network drivers are one of them.

---------------------------------------
Q13 - How to use the surround channel?

If application supports channel selection use 'WavePro All' channel.
This will use all of your cards channels.

If application doesn't support channel selection go to ControlPanel->Sound and select 'WavePro All' channel
as default channel.

Notice:
for 4xx cards you can open 4 channels at a time, so maximum of QUAD Surround mode can be used
for 824 cards you can open 8 channels at a time, so maximum of 7+1 Sourround mode can be used

Notice2:
If 'WavePro All' channel is opened all other channels will be disabled.
